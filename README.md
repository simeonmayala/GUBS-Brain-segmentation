# minimum-spanning-tree-segmentation

The two notebooks (brain_segmentation1 and brain_segmentation2) are the same. The only difference is that 
brain_segmentation1.ipynb applies a threshold for disconnecting some parts of the brain from the non-brain tissues (For OASIS AND IBSR)
brain_segmentation2.ipynb does not applya threshold for disconnecting some parts of the brain from the non-brain tissues (BW data)
