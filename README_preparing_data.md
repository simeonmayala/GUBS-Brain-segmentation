# minimum-spanning-tree-segmentation
The two jupyternotebook are used for preparing data from IBSR and OASIS.
The notebooks only need a path where the dataset are saved. Also add a path where you want the preprocessed files to be saved.
The notebook iterates on the files, resizes, scales and saves them into .npy formatt. The names from the input image are extracted automatically 
and used for saving the processed files.
The processed files are loaded in the notebook for segmentation
